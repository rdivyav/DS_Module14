# Ex7 Priority Queue
## DATE:28-4-2025
## AIM:
To formulate the C code to display the elements of the priority queue after insertion and deletion operation.

## Algorithm
1. Check for Emptiness
2. Create a Temporary Queue
3. Extract and Store Elements
4. Display Elements 
5.Restore the Original Queue    

## Program:
```

```
```
/*#include <stdio.h>
int size = 0;
*/
void printArray(int *array, int size) {
  int i;
 for (i=0;i<size;i++)
 {
     printf("%d ",array[i]);
 }
}
